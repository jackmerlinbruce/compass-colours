#Â TODO:
- when hovering over each country, it draws a line to the centroid of every country that it invaded / used to be in an empire with: https://www.paulhensel.org/icownames.html, http://www.correlatesofwar.org/data-sets/cow-country-codes
- country appears at end of line
- would be cool if it did it in order of Invasion Year

# DEFENCE CONTRACTS
- to use the GeoPath arcs to visualise which countries have the most defence contracts
- http://www.correlatesofwar.org/data-sets/defense-cooperation-agreement-dataset
- animate by year

# INTERGOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS, OVER TIME
- http://www.correlatesofwar.org/data-sets/IGOs/
- over time, for each IGO, increast the opacity of the member countries by +1
- which counties have the more or least number of IGO?
